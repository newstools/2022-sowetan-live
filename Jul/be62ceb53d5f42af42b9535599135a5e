Wayde van Niekerk will miss the Commonwealth Games  again. The 400m world record-holder, who is still trying to recapture his form after undergoing knee surgery in 2017, was not among the 26 track and field athletes named by the SA Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (Sascoc) on Monday. He was still recuperating from the operation at the time of the last Games in Gold Coast and safeguarding his knee possibly cost him a chance of making the team for the showpiece that kicks off in Birmingham later this month. Van Niekerk withdrew from the SA championships in April as a precautionary measure, pulled up in a 200m race in Italy in May, and completed only his first race of the season, a 400m in the US, this past weekend. That performance at least showed he had reasonable form  before the world championships from July 15 to 24. An Athletics SA board member said selections were based on performances from January 1 until mid-June, during which Van Niekerk didn’t complete a race. A further 61 competitors across six codes were added to Team SA on Monday, bringing the total  to take part in England to 251 — 57 more than the squad that went to Gold Coast 2018. The bulk of the team for the Birmingham spectacle that runs until August 8 was announced last month. Included in the squad is embattled wrestler Arno van Zijl, who has been dragged through a drawn-out disciplinary process by his national federation since early April. The matter is still pending against the 20-year-old, who is one of four wrestlers in the team. The athletics side features most of SA’s stars, including veteran sprinter Akani Simbine, the defending 100m champion, and rising young guns  such as shot putter Kyle Blignaut, 800m runner Prudence Sekgodiso and 110m hurdler Marioné Fourie. The Games is the arena where many SA’s sports stars have achieved early success,  such as Van Niekerk, who took the 400m silver at Glasgow 2014, and breaststroke queens Tatjana Schoenmaker in 2018 and Penny Heyns in 1994. Team SA has been fairly consistent at the Games since 1998, finishing between fifth and seventh on the medals table. Four years ago they ended sixth with 37 medals, including 13 gold.
