By reaching the Africa Women’s Cup of Nations (Wafcon) final, Banyana Banyana players are already guaranteed R55,000 each in bonuses and for some, lucrative transfers could be on the cards. Safa promised Banyana a package of R9,2m in bonuses, with each player ensured to take home a whopping R400,000 if they come back home with the Wafcon trophy. Banyana take on  hosts Morocco in the final at the 53,000-seater Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium on Saturday (10pm SA time). At least 35,000 fans are expected. One of the Banyana players who has been outstanding in Morocco is goalkeeper Andile Dlamini, who is Mamelodi Sundowns Ladies’ property. “Stick”, as Dlamini is known to her peers, has emphasised they’re not thinking about the bonuses, focusing at preparing for the final. “Look, we know we were promised big bonuses but we’re not thinking about that at this stage. Our focus is on the final. We want to prepare as best as we can to make sure we win the game on Saturday,” Dlamini told Sowetan after the Zambia clash at Stade Mohammed V in Casablanca on Monday. Yesterday, Banyana returned to Rabat, where they were  initially based before going to Casablanca two days before the game against Zambia in the semifinals. SA needed a stoppage-time penalty, netted by Linda Motlhalo, to overcome She-polopolo. About possibly earning a big move, Dlamini said: “I am a Sundowns player... if anyone wants me they must go to Sundowns. I believe it’s God who’ll decide if I get a move overseas or not. It’s not mine to want things because God is there for that. If He chooses me to go and play in Europe it will happen and if not, then it means He sees the timing isn’t right. His timing is always perfect,” Dlamini said.
