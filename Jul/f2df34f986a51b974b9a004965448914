Manchester City have signed goalkeeper Stefan Ortega from German side Arminia Bielefeld  in a three-year deal, the Premier League club announced on Friday. The 29-year-old German, who was out of contract at Arminia, played 33  of 34 of their league games in the 2021-2022 season, but was unable to help them avoid relegation. "This is a fantastic move for me," Ortega said. "Manchester City are an amazing team — a squad with world-class quality in every area." Ortega will be second choice to Ederson, with back-up goalkeeper Zack Steffen, who made a costly error in City's FA Cup semi-final defeat to Liverpool in April, linked with a move away from the club.
