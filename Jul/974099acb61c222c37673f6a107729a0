The death toll  in  the mass shooting at  Mdlalose’s tavern in Nomzamo,  Soweto, has risen to 16. This was revealed by  Gauteng MEC for community safety Faith Mazibuko. She visited the area on Tuesday for a prayer meeting with the families of  victims. Mazibuko was accompanied by social development department officials, faith-based organisations, councillors and block committee leaders. “Today we are in Nomzamo again. Unfortunately, a 16th person has succumbed to his injuries. He is a young man,” she said. Talking to the media on the sidelines of a prayer session with the families of victims, Mazibuko  said  the provincial government  was working around the clock  to assist the families. “The bodies of most of the deceased might be going to KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape,” she said. “We will work together with  long-distance taxis associations  because they need transport.  Avbob has come on board to  assist with burials. “Police are working flat out to ensure they bring the perpetrators to book. The team  has  gathered a lot of information that will assist them to  make arrests.” A total of 23 people were shot inside the  tavern in the early hours  on Sunday  when gunmen opened fire on patrons. A dozen people were certified dead on the scene, while others died in hospital. Asked if all the families of  victims had identified their loved ones, Gauteng police spokesperson Col Dimakatso Sello said: “Not yet.” TimesLIVE
