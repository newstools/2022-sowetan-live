The defence attorney in the rape trial of bishop Stephen Bafana Zondo on Tuesday  suggested to the woman who accused him of raping her at a hotel that it was not Zondo who raped her but a well-known gospel artist. However, the woman denied it, saying at the time of her rape she had not met the artist.  She  only met  him in 2010 when she joined his group. The woman, who is  testifying in camera in the Pretoria high court, said on Monday  she was 23 when she was raped, threatened and  offered R75,000 for her silence by Zondo  in 2008. She  told the court  Zondo had called and asked that they meet in Vereeniging. She left work early that day,  met Zondo and they drove to the hotel where the rape occurred. National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesperson Lumka Mahanjana said the victim  was herself a gospel artist. On Tuesday she was quizzed on whether she had an agreement with  a radio presenter to whom she revealed the incident that they would promote her CD. She denied it and said she did the interview to talk about the incident, but when the presenter found out  she is a gospel artist they played her song during the interview. The witness denied  she was influenced by Solly Poopedi, who used to be a member of the church, to  approach the CRL Commission. The woman  said she heard about the  commission  on an online radio station in 2021  and was told that Poopedi can assist her. “She told the court  she would have reported the matter even if the accused had given her the R75,000,” said Mahanjana. Zondo, who heads the Rivers of Living Waters Ministries, is accused of raping seven women and trying to bribe one to drop a case. He faces a total of 10 charges, including rape, indecent assault and defeating the ends of justice. The cross-examination of this witness is expected to continue on Wednesday morning. TimesLIVE
