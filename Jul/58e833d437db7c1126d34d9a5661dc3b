A  North West pensioner  who enjoys watching TV can now afford to do much more  than watch the small screen. The 70-year-old from Rustenburg  won the PowerBall Plus jackpot, bagging R33.1m, from the draw  on June 28. According to an Ithuba statement on Tuesday, the man has been playing the national lottery games for nine years. This is not the only time he has won. His previous win was R80 — a  drop in the ocean compared  with this jackpot. He bought his R30 ticket  via the manual selection. “I am so happy. I am going to build houses for my wife and child. Winning this amount will definitely make a big difference in my life,” he told Ithuba. According to the lottery operator, the man  worked in the mining industry for most of his life. “He now spends most of his time relaxing and watching TV.” The man discovered his big win when he checked his ticket numbers on the internet.
