The Gauteng department of health said a fire that broke out on Tuesday night and was confined to a small section of  level two parking at the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital  has been contained. The department said the parking area is one of  those  affected by the April 2021 fire. It is  currently  not accessible to the public or staff,  except for construction workers. Department spokesperson Motalatale Modiba said the “smouldering fire” has been brought under control. He said the situation is  being closely monitored by a multidisciplinary team  on-site to further assess the situation. “Late on Tuesday night  security personnel reported  there was smoke that seemed to be coming from one of the structures. Firefighters  immediately responded to the situation and managed to contain the fire, which was confined to a small section of the level two parking.  Hillbrow  police officers went to the site after the matter was reported to them,” said Modiba. He said  clinicians on site together with the facility’s head of disaster made a call that the situation did not warrant for patients to be evacuated as  smoke from the fire was not  thick and there was no high risk of  inhalation. Services at the facility continue to be rendered as usual. TimesLIVE
