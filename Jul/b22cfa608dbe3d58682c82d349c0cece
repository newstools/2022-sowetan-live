Safa president Danny Jordaan entreated Banyana Banyana to beat regional rivals Zambia in the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations (Wafcon) semifinal tie at Mohammed V Stadium in Casablanca, Morocco on Monday night to commemorate International Nelson Mandela Day in style. Kickoff is at 7pm SA time. Speaking to the SA media after Banyana concluded a training session in Casablanca on Sunday, Jordaan emphasised the importance of Banyana outwitting Zambia on a special day for the country, when the late iconic president Mandela would have celebrated his 104th birthday. “Our country needs icons at this time. Madiba is a global icon and now the world is talking about Banyana. Banyana  being Madiba’s team. Madiba loved football and supported this team. Banyana are our ambassadors, so I implore them to win against Zambia to celebrate  Mandela Day in style,” said Jordaan in Morocco. Jordaan is also convinced Banyana are the best team at Wafcon based on their enterprising style of  football, revealing that their admirers include  Senegalese FA president Augustin Senghor. “Everybody here in Morocco is saying Banyana produces the best football. They must just finish the job by winning against Zambia, and go to the final to win gain. If they start playing, there's no team that can touch them,” said the Safa boss. “They’re the best football-playing team here. The president of [the] Senegal [FA] told me that your team deserves to be the winners here because they play brilliantly.” By reaching the semifinals, Banyana players are already guaranteed to pocket R30,000 each in bonuses as promised by Safa before departing for the tournament. Jordaan reiterated the players will get their bonuses in time. “We will honour our commitment and the players will get paid in time. They know their responsibility and we know our commitment,” said Jordaan. • Ndebele is in Morocco as Banyana sponsor Sasol’s guest
