Orlando Pirates  striker Boitumelo Radiopane scored a brace in his side’s 3-1 win over Royal AM  to continue his fine form in the DStv Diski Challenge at the Mpumalanga Stadium at the weekend. His  goals in either half and a Nkosinathi Themba strike  were enough to give Mandla Qhogi's team the full three points in the reserve league. Pirates maintained their dominance on top of the log with 39 points from 16 games. Radiopane's two goals took his season tally to 16 so far, with the impressive haul and rate at which his scoring is likely to go a long way in getting him more first-team opportunities this season. He has already featured four times for the Pirates senior team in the DStv Premiership. There were vital wins for  Stellenbosh FC  and Chippa United who are in second  and third.
