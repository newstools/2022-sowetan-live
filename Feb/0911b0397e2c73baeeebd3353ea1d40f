Cape Town City hope work permits for their three new foreigners arrive in time for Tuesday’s home clash against Kaizer Chiefs, otherwise the club will be  a bit depleted for an important  game. A clean out at City in the January transfer window proved a shock, but  club chairman John Comitis did not hesitate when offers arrived for Abdul Jeleel Ajagun, Fagrie Lakay and Surprise Ralani. All three have been sold, while Abbubaker Mobara went to AmaZulu and left-back Edmilson Dove had his contract terminated. Shane Roberts was loaned to TS Galaxy and Zimbabwe striker Douglas Mapfumo was sent back to the GladAfrica Championship. It has left Eric Tinkler’s squad somewhat threadbare, emphasised on Saturday by a shortage of substitutes when they took on Royal AM in the first round of the Nedbank Cup. City had only seven players on the bench as work permits for new foreign acquisitions — Kajally Drammeh (Gambia), Darwin Gonzalez (Venezuela) and Cameroon defensive midfielder Brice Ambina — failed to come through in time. The club is  anxiously waiting to see whether they will  be issued in time to   register the players with the Premier Soccer League before the Chiefs’ game, which kicks off at 7.30pm at the Cape Town stadium. Foreigners must  have work permits issued by  home affairs before being allowed to register with the league. City were ahead early against Royal AM but lost 2-1 and were eliminated from the cup, followed  hours later on Saturday by Chiefs. It makes Tuesday’s game important  for both Tinkler and his Chefs counterpart Stuart Baxter, who has been under  considerable pressure from  fans since the 0-1 home loss to TS Galaxy. City, whose December clash at Soccer City did not take place as Chiefs said  they were unable to field a team because of a Covid-19 crisis, have a poor home record against Amakhosi, who have won on their past  four league visits to City.
