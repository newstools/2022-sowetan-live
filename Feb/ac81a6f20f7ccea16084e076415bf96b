A woman is being treated in hospital for multiple  injuries after her car veered off Chapman's Peak Drive in Cape Town, plunged down the mountain and caught alight on Thursday. Wilderness Search and Rescue spokesperson Johan Marais said  details of the accident are not clear, “but it appears that her vehicle went over the edge and burst  into flames and set the surrounding vegetation on fire”. More than 50 emergency services personnel and volunteers from various organisations, including Working on Fire, were called in to assist with the rescue of the woman, who was seriously injured. While helicopters battled the blaze around the wreck to protect the woman from the fire, paramedics stabilised her before bringing her up from the mountain slopes to the road. “When the helicopters were able to bring the fire under control, firefighters were deployed  to attend to flare-ups,” said Marais. “Wilderness Search and Rescue volunteers brought a stretcher down the slope, helped secure the patient and  brought her  up to the road  using a rope system. An ambulance took her to hospital where she was admitted with multiple and severe injuries.” The vehicle was  burnt out. ER24 said the woman  is 25 years old. “It is understood that the woman’s vehicle left the edge of Chapman’s Peak and had rolled before coming to a stop about  100 metres down the mountain,” the paramedic service said.
