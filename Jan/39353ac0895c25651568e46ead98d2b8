President Cyril Ramaphosa will hear on Tuesday if there is proof of malfeasance in former president Jacob Zuma's administration when he receives the first part of the state capture report from acting chief justice Raymond Zondo. Zondo  is expected to hand over the first of three parts of the report to the president at 4pm. Earlier on Tuesday, the high court in Johannesburg  struck off the roll the application of lobby group Democracy In Action to stop  Ramaphosa from receiving the first part of the  report. Democracy In Action  had asked the  court to find that Ramaphosa was “implicated” by witnesses at the inquiry and should therefore not be the one to receive the report. TimesLIVE
