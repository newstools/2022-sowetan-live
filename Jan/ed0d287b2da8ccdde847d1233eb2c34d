The 11-year-old girl who was kidnapped outside a primary school in Mayfair, Johannesburg, has been found. Police spokesperson Lt-Col Robert Netshiunda confirmed that the girl was found in Freedom Park, in the south of Johannesburg, on Tuesday but would not give further details. “Our officers are still processing the entire matter and in due course, we will release a statement. We just don’t want to give information in pieces because there is still a lot to look into,” Netshiunda said. In November, three armed men kidnapped the girl outside EP Baumann Primary School after she was dropped off by her mother. Witnesses told Sowetan at the time that her assailants forced her into their getaway car, a silver Toyota, at about 7am. Sowetan established that the kidnapped girl’s family owned a couple of businesses around Mayfair, just 17km from Freedom Park where their daughter was found.
