Alleged parliament fire suspect Zandile Mafe is set to apply for bail on Saturday in Cape Town. The 49-year-old's legal counsel, Dali Mpofu, arrived at 10am at the regional court amid a strong police presence and a small group of Mafe supporters singing outside. Mafe has been in custody since January 2 when a fire broke out at the parliament buildings, leaving the National Assembly gutted. TimesLIVE
