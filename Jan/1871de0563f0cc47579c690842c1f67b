ANC deputy president David Mabuza  says the party will  no longer allow rogue and criminal elements to exist within  the organisation. Mabuza’s comments came  when he was addressing a crowd of supporters and ANC Youth League members at a wreath-laying ceremony at the grave of former league president Peter Mokaba. “We’re going to rebuild and renew our movement. We are going to get rid of all rogue elements in the movement,” Mabuza  told the crowd gathered  in Mankweng, Limpopo, “Young people  are here to recommit themselves, to emulate and walk in the footsteps of Peter Mokaba and his generation.” The event was part of the build-up to the ANCs 110th birthday  celebrations in Polokwane on Saturday.
