Pam Vishnu, owner of the home, told TimesLIVE  her 28-year-old son  used a pellet gun to send the trio packing. “This happened on Saturday afternoon. These guys were so brazen. “I am grateful they did not retaliate. My son was home alone and watching TV when he spotted them on the camera. “He grabbed a pellet gun and went outside. If I was home I would have panicked. He was calm and managed to send them away. “I shared the footage on our  neighbourhood group to make residents aware. “The men removed our gate so easily. It’s frightening and we feel very violated. I’m  relieved  my son was unharmed,” said Vishnu. TimesLIVE
