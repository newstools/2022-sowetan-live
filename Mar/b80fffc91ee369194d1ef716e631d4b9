The City of Tshwane is going to court to halt a strike by driving schools which has disrupted services at licensing centres in the city and around Gauteng. Tshwane MMC for roads and transport Dikeledi Selowa said the city was  applying for a court interdict against protesting National Driving School Association of SA (NDSASA) members to stop them from disrupting city operations. “We will not tolerate lawlessness in Tshwane. Protesting driving schools should not be allowed to hold customers  to ransom. I wish to convey my sincere apologies to customers who are inconvenienced by the interruptions,” she said. Several licensing centres in Gauteng have shut  after two weeks of protests organised by the NDSASA against a new online booking system. Members of NDSASA are demanding that the online e-NaTIS booking system be cancelled, saying it disadvantaged them financially as they could no longer make bookings on behalf of clients for a fee. Driving licence testing centres (DLTCs) and motor vehicle registration offices remain closed  because of the protests, Selowa said. “As a result of the violence shown by protesters to both staff and clients,  Tshwane’s roads and transport department took a decision to cease operations to protect lives and infrastructure.” She said licensing centres closed until further notice include: The city said it would keep residents updated on developments.
