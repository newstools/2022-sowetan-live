The Johannesburg high court has struck off the roll an urgent application against the Dudula campaign by a group of foreign nationals due to its lack of urgency. In a move to stop the campaign, a group of foreign nationals had approached the  high court for relief against the campaign targeting migrant traders, stating the court bid will prevent loss of life in case xenophobic violence flares up. Judge Jabu Dlamini dismissed the application, stating that it lacked urgency. Dlamini raised concerns with having to issue a blanket ban against the group marching as there were no specific details on a march or gathering that he needed to prohibit. The group of 38 foreign nationals residing in Gauteng wanted the court to interdict the activities of Dudula, a movement made of South African residents in various townships who seek action be taken against illegal immigrants. The movement made news in the past weeks for attacking businesses run by foreign nationals. Dlamini said he couldn't be able to issue an order which prohibited any march. "I can't prohibit a march we don't know where and who is going to be marching... we don't even know when they are going to march," Dlamini said. The applicants were represented by lawyer Mabu Marweshe. He said  Dudula was operating like a syndicate and that its  next operation was unknown to those who are not part of it. He also argued that the group was a law unto itself and had often clashed with police and it doesn't respect authorities. The Dudula  operations began  in Soweto last year but have since spread to Alexandra, Ekurhuleni townships of Tembisa and Daveyton and the  Johannesburg inner city, including Hillbrow, and Orange Grove.
