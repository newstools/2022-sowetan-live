KwaZulu-Natal driving school owners took to the highway  on Wednesday demanding their share of Covid-19 relief funds and demarcated spaces for training. Traffic on the N3 was backed up from Shongweni as more than 30 driving school cars were “marching” peacefully. There was an altercation between police and  protesters, who also demanded that  basic education minister Angie Motshekga  not  “interfere” in their business. This after  a  proposal by the basic education department to have pupils offered driving  lessons at schools. Driving at 20km/h,  the protesters were on their way to Pietermaritzburg to hand over their memorandum of grievances to the office of  KwaZulu-Natal premier Sihle Zikalala. TimesLIVE
