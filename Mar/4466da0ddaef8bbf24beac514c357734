Two people died early on Sunday morning in what rescue paramedics described as a “horrific” motor vehicle collision on the N1 in Johannesburg. Paramedics say the cause of the collision and events leading up to it were unclear. Emergency rescue service Emer-G-Med said just after midnight a delivery vehicle was involved in a crash in a northbound lane after the Rivonia Road off-ramp in Sunninghill. Paramedics arrived on the scene to find the twisted wreckage of a light delivery vehicle. “The occupants of the vehicle had been ejected and lay strewn over the roadway.” Two occupants sustained fatal injuries. A third, found in a critical condition, was treated and stabilised before being airlifted to a specialist facility for further medical care. An investigation into the cause of the accident is under way. TimesLIVE
