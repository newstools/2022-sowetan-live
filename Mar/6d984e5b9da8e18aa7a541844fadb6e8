A 15-year old Pinetown boy is fighting for his life after a stabbing incident outside his school. Emer-G-Med Paramedics' Kyle van Reenen said emergency staff responded to reports of a stabbing outside a school in the Ashley area of Pinetown, west of Durban, on Friday. “On arrival on scene a 15-year-old male was found to have sustained a stab wound to his abdomen and was in a critical condition.” Van Reenen said advanced life support intervention was needed to stabilise him, before he was placed on a mechanical ventilator to assist him to breathe, and transported to a nearby hospital. This is a developing story. TimesLIVE
