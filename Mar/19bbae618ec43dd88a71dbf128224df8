Mineral resources and energy minister Gwede Mantashe is the latest to be caught apparently  napping in parliament. In a video shared by DA MP Solly Malatsi, Mantashe apparently fell asleep during an oral question and answers session on Wednesday. “It seems as though this sleepy ‘tiger’ has lost all its prowess," Malatsi wrote. According to Malatsi, the minister “dug deep to be energetic”. “He was struggling earlier,” he said. Attempts to obtain comment from  Mantashe and his department were unsuccessful at the time of publishing this article. Any response will be included once received. Mantashe is not the first cabinet minister to be caught apparently enjoying his sleep in parliament this week. A video of arts and culture minister Nathi Mthethwa apparently falling asleep during the same sitting was also circulated on social media DA MP Leon Schreiber shared the video of Mthethwa, saying: “Here is a member of [President Cyril] Ramaphosa’s poverty cabinet, Nathi Mthethwa, fast asleep during a session of parliament. “The DA’s motion of no confidence in this cabinet has never been more urgent.”
