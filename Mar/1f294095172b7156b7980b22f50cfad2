The Gauteng traffic police department has warned that major roads leading to the province are expected to be heavily congested this afternoon as holidaymakers return home after the Human Rights Day long weekend. Motorists have been urged to be vigilant after six road users lost their lives on Gauteng roads in separate incidents at the weekend. “This includes a crash on the N1 north on Sunday night between Rivonia Road and Bowling Avenue, among others. In that crash, two people lost their lives after a Volkswagen Amarok bumped a heavy motor vehicle at the rear. The cause of the crash is unknown at this stage and investigations are  underway,” said Gauteng traffic police spokesperson Sello Maremane. Maremane said many  motorists and holidaymakers are expected to travel back to their homes after spending the long weekend with  loved ones. “ Gauteng traffic police call upon motorists to obey the rules of the road and  traffic signs at all times. “The contributory factors leading to road fatalities in our province include unsafe overtaking, speeding and driving under the influence of alcohol,” he said. Maremane said  major roads expected to be heavily congested include: “ Gauteng traffic police have arrested more than 70 motorists since last Friday for driving under the influence of alcohol. Law enforcement authorities will continue to clamp down on motorists who continue to conduct themselves with impunity and endanger  lives  on Gauteng roads,” said Maremane. TimesLIVE
