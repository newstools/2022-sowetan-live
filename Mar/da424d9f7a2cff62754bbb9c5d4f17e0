Mandla Ncikazi says he understands the frustrations of Orlando Pirates' supporters, who ask for their team to perform better. Bucs bounced back from a tough run of three matches without a win — including a 2-1 Soweto derby defeat against Kaizer Chiefs and being knocked out of the Nedbank Cup on penalties by Marumo Gallants — with Sunday's 3-1 Caf Confederation Cup win against Royal Leopards at Orlando Stadium. The Confed, where Pirates lead Group B and are on course for the quarterfinals, is Bucs' last hope at silverware. In the DStv Premiership, where they meet SuperSport United in a big match at Orlando Stadium on Wednesday night (7.30pm), Pirates are in fourth place, but 19 points behind leaders Mamelodi Sundowns. Ncikazi and co-coach Fadlu Davids have come in for some stick from  supporters as Bucs have struggled, and will look for more relief by following their Confed win against Eswatini's Leopards with a league win against seventh-placed SuperSport. “I'm feeling bad for the supporters — they deserve better,” Ncikazi said, asked about the criticism he and Davids have received. “I'm not happy for our management — they deserve better. But personally as a coach, the day you get hired you must be ready to be fired. “I don't think there's a coach in any league who's not feeling under pressure, and I'm in the same pool. So the pressure, I understand. “I understand the frustrations of the Pirates supporters — they want their team to be in a better state. So more than me, it's about the frustration they are going through. “I wish I could change it so that it can be better. But it is what it is — we are just missing goals. “I think we are one of those teams playing so well but we just miss the main part. So it's not about me — it's about the supporters getting what they deserve.”
