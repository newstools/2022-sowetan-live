While it was our  wish to keep this private and make the relevant pronouncements at the appropriate time, we believe it is in the best interest of the public to share that Luzuko lost a short and vigorously fought battle against cancer,” said Nontobeko Mabitsela, the family’s spokesperson. Koti died on Monday, at the Netcare Pretoria East Hospital where he was receiving medical attention. He was 47 years old.
