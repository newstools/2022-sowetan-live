Zimbabweans are  taking flak from the Ukraine/Russia conflict. On Monday, the Grain Millers Association of Zimbabwe (GMAZ) announced a 15% increase in the price of mealie meal and bread flour. GMAZ chair Tafadzwa Musarara said the increase was the result of the Russia — Ukraine war and warned that prices may  rise further because of  supply chain challenges. “The Grain Marketing Board had increased the cost of maize from ZWL$43,000  to ZWL$50,000 per  tonne, necessitating an upward review in mealie meal prices. Coupled with this, fuel prices have also surged  with the geopolitics in the Balkan region, in particular the Russia-Ukraine conflict, adding substantially to operating costs,” said Musarara. The retail price for 10kg of Roller Meal brand maize meal will increase from ZWL$955 to ZWL$1,099. Bread flour will  rise  14.74% from ZWL$119,000 to ZWL$136,544 a   tonne. GMAZ said it was costing  significantly more to get wheat into the country with the landing price increasing from US$475 to US$675. Zimbabwe requires 400,000 tonnes of wheat a  year, mainly for flour and bread. The country imports 50% of the wheat from Russia. Last week, Zimbabwe increased fuel prices twice in five days. The  hike was attributed to surging international oil prices.
