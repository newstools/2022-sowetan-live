Al Ahly head coach Pitso Mosimane is in high spirits before the club's game against his former team Mamelodi Sundowns in the Confederation of African Football (Caf) Champions League on Saturday. Arriving at OR Tambo International Airport earlier this week for the Group A match, Mosimane said he was confident his team will make fans proud. “You have to imagine what is Al Ahly, it's the biggest club in the continent. And I am not talking about when it was established, in terms of history. I am talking about also the titles and support base. “Name me one team in the continent that has 70 million people looking at you every day, every match,” said Mosimane. Mosimane was heckled, booed and sworn at when Al Ahly clashed with Sundowns at the Lucas Moripe Stadium last May. Sundowns fans hurled insults at Mosimane after his team secured a place in the Caf Champions League semifinals with a 1-1 draw. Addressing media, Sundowns goalkeeper Kennedy Mweene said the  match was not about Mosimane. “Yes, he was our coach, but at the same time it's not about him. It is about our teams, Sundowns and Al Ahly,” said Mweene. “For us, it is to go into the game and do what we have to do. At the end of the day we all have respect for coach Pitso because a lot of us  have been coached by him. “But I have to say this, it is about Sundowns and Al Ahly,  not us against coach Pitso.”
