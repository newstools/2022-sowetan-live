“Honourable Malema, I hear what you have said, but I fear f*k*l.” President Cyril Ramaphosa surprised MPs during a question-and-answer session on Thursday afternoon. Ramaphosa was addressing EFF leader Julius Malema’s question  about policing in SA  and  whether he was  afraid of removing police minister Bheki Cele. Ramaphosa later apologised for the statement and said he  meant to say “niks” instead of “f*k*l”. Questions related to rising food and fuel prices, the Ukraine-Russia war  and the  inclusion of African countries in the UNSC were among other matters that arose. TimesLIVE
