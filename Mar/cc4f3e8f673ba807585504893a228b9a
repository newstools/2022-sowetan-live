The KwaZulu-Natal education department has placed the principal of Grosvenor Girls' High School on precautionary suspension pending an investigation into allegations of racism. Last week chaos ensued at the school when  education MEC Kwazi Mshengu visited  and some parents and EFF supporters claimed they were not given a chance to engage him about  allegations of racism. The department said on Monday  it was acting on the recommendations of an independent panel  announced last week by Mshengu to investigate the allegations about  the Bluff-based school. “The panel is led by Vusi Khuzwayo (SC) and is supported by advocate Makhosini Nkosi, who is an evidence leader, Dr Nontobeko Buthelezi, an educational psychologist, Jacqueline Pretorius-Bishop and the secretariat that is provided by SD Moloi and Associates.” Mshengu said  the panel would be given 21 days to complete its investigation to prevent the mistake of “shortcuts” during a 2019 probe when the school  faced  similar issues. Principal Linda Jorgensen was named by  parents and pupils  in last week's emotionally-charged meeting. One pupil  could not hold back her tears when she narrated how the principal allegedly “enabled racism” after she had a fight with a fellow pupil. Parents also alleged that the principal called the girls names. “The panel has been at work and in consultation with the department over the weekend. Upon looking at the correspondence submitted to it by the department, the panel deemed it fit to recommend the suspension of the principal to facilitate an investigation that will not be marred by  difficulties for those who will voluntarily give evidence.” The department said it would allow parents and current and former pupils  to submit  information related to the allegations against the school.
