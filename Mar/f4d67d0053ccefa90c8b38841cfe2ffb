Formidable Egyptian giants Al Ahly SC and coach Pitso Mosimane arrived at OR Tambo International Airport on Wednesday for their big Caf Champions League Group A matchup against Mamelodi Sundowns at the FNB Stadium on Saturday. Ahly arrived fresh from a big 3-0 win and inflicting a first Egyptian Premier League defeat of the season on Pyramids FC at the Al Salam Stadium on Tuesday night, just  before their departure from Cairo International Airport in the early hours of Wednesday. The result saw Mosimane’s team go top of the league, toppling Pyramids to second. They were also boosted by Mosimane resolving his long contract negotiations signing a two-year deal announced by the club on Wednesday morning. Ahly are out  to revenge  the 1-0 shock Downs inflicted in Cairo two weekends ago. The Red Devils are the back-to-back Champions League winners, and record 10-time champions of Africa’s premier continental club competition. The video is courtesy of Front Runner.
