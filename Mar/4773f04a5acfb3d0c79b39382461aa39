The Zulu royal household is optimistic that the family will  overcome internal disputes which have seen it  hauled before  court and  their funds frozen. So said family spokesperson Prince Thulani Zulu who was speaking at the Pietermaritzburg high court on Wednesday where judge Isaac Madondo ruled that the coronation of Prince Misuzulu kaZwelithini as king of the Zulus  can go ahead. “All we need is stability in our family. We are  citizens of the country and we obey our constitution,” Zulu  said. It wasn't the first time  the Zulu royal family had been embroiled in leadership battles. Zulu said in the time of King Cetshwayo, the  monarchy had been rocked by bitter succession battles which  claimed the lives of siblings. “We are fortunate that this time around there have  been no casualties. This is  a misunderstanding that will pass.” Zulu said he  hoped  the disputes would bring an end to the suspension of funding by the KZN  government. “We have community projects which we need to do. We hope once everything is over government can make a resolution.” In September last year the provincial government said it had taken a “resolution to allow the Zulu royal household space and  opportunity to resolve family-related issues without external interference”. “As such, the executive council has resolved to delay its support and funding for  cultural activities until the disputes related to the Zulu royal household kingship are resolved.” TimesLIVE
