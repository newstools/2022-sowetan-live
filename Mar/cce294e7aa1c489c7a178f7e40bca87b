Correctional Services spokesperson Singabakho Nxumalo said on Sunday an investigation was under way after the death of two inmates at Tswelopelo Correctional Centre. “It has been confirmed that three inmates were involved when an official was attacked, through the usage of padlocks. “Other officials responded and in attempting to defuse the situation, a scuffle with inmates ensued. “Three inmates suffered injuries and were referred to an outside hospital at different intervals, and sadly, two of them passed away. “The other inmate remains in hospital for extended medical care. “The seriousness of the incident warrants a full-scale investigation.
