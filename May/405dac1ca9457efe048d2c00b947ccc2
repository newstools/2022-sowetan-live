Mzansi's finest Bonang Matheba stole the show in Nigeria as co-host of the Africa Magic Viewers' Choice Awards (AMVCA). Matheba hosted the prestigious awards with Nigerian TV and radio presenter Ik Osakioduwa in Lagos on Saturday night. Movies Rattlesnake – The Ahanna Story and Amina came tops with four AMVCA respectively, while best director went to Ramsey Nouah (Rattlesnake – The Ahanna Story). But perhaps the real action was on the red carpet and Queen B slayed her emceeing duties in four outfit changes. Her opening look was an ethereal pink gown by Sheyeoladeio. The high-neck and pink fur finishing oozed mystical creature. The Nigerian radio personality didn’t come to play. She stepped out in a fiery gown by Matopeda Atelier and was styled by Dah Mola. She definitely understood the assignment. Nwachukwu did a stellar job representing the men. He donned a floral suit by Alan Cruzer Bespoke. The actor was a shimmering goddess in a sheer embellished mermaid gown by Veekee James. Etomi went for a simple yet elegant gown by Matopeda Atelier that had her looking like royalty. Akpofure brought a pop of colour in a turquoise suit made by. Déjà vu! Drey channelled Kim Kardashian in Balenciaga at the Met Gala last year, in a dramatic all-black ensemble designed by Whitney Black. The high-fashion look was finished with a bold face mask.
