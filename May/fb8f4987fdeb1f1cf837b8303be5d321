Al Ahly coach Pitso Mosimane will  launch a schools soccer programme this year as part of his plan to give back to the sport in SA, his management team MT Sports has confirmed. Mosimane, who enjoyed unrivalled success with Mamelodi Sundowns, is a match away from a hat-trick of successive Caf Champions League titles with the Egyptian giants. MT Sports said the programme, to be known as Pitso Mosimane Soccer Schools (PMSS), seeks to produce a well-balanced “player of tomorrow”. “The PMSS is part of coach Pitso’s legacy of not only creating the player of tomorrow, but also ensuring he contributes to football in SA for it to go back to the level of excellence that we know it to be and, most importantly, reaching new heights,” said Moira Tlhagale,  MD of the MT Sports Marketing and Management agency. “Throughout his career as a player and coach, Pitso Mosimane has been a perpetual student of the game, ensuring he continuously amasses football knowledge.” MT Sports said the aim of the  initiative is to develop a football programme that will have a holistic approach to developing players on and off the field. The programme will aim to produce a “player of tomorrow” who will be balanced academically, socially and  technically. “Key elements that form part of the PMSS programme are to ensure the employment of the right calibre of coaches, adherence to a specified development plan and ensuring the environment  the players are in is safe and encouraged to thrive,” MT Sports  GM Keletso Totlhanyo  said.
