In his address to the Mining Indaba, President Cyril Ramaphosa put his finger on many key issues to regenerate SA's mining industry, but the speech could have had more timelines and action plans to drive investors. Ramaphosa, delivering the keynote address  in Cape Town on Tuesday, spoke well and highlighted several important issues  the country needs to address to grow the mining industry. On a positive note, the president correctly: Where the mark may have been missed was on the following points: Though Ramaphosa's  speech more comprehensively addressed the issues facing the industry than the minerals minister’s speech,   the president could have given more concrete action plans and timelines to try to build investor confidence. Once again, at a time when the global commodity sector is cresting a wave, SA may miss the boat. This is particularly important as the global appetite for commodities is moving towards battery metals, with which SA is not particularly well endowed, other than in platinum and manganese. While the president omitted to address certain issues (set out above), it is clear from his address that the  government is seeking new and innovative ways to increase investment in SA while still progressing a just transition to a green economy.
