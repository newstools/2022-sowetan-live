She is OK now, she feels no pain, no one is hurting her and no one is giving her a headache.” Fraser’s sister Lorna said: “Debra had so much love. She loved our children. She would never walk in empty-handed when she came to see them. We lived with her and rejoiced. Some of our siblings are gone. There were 10 of us and now only two are left.”
