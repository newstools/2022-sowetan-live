Higher education and training minister Blade Nzimande has appointed a forensic company to conduct a full-scale investigation into the financial affairs of the national skills fund (NSF). Just under R5bn could not be “properly accounted for over two financial years’", he said  while tabling his 2022/2023 budget  in parliament on Thursday. “As a department we are  committed to deal with  maladministration and corruption at the national skills fund.” Despite this, Nzimande said the fund would  support  scholarships and bursaries  in 2022/2023  by providing R866m. The budget is expected to be distributed as follows: Last year, Nzimande came under fire  in parliament's standing committee on public accounts (Scopa) for hiring private forensic investigators to conduct  a probe instead of using the Special Investigating Unit (SIU). Nzimande  said the plan was to forward the findings by the private investigation to the SIU, which is empowered to  take the matter further. He  said government was committed to financially support students from poor and working class backgrounds while also putting a sustainable mechanism in place to support students from the so-called “missing middle” and postgraduate students. The department’s budget for the 2022/2023 financial year is R130.1bn, with an annual average increase of 7%. The budget is expected to be distributed between six programmes:  administration; planning; policy and strategy; university education; technical and vocational education and training; skills development and community education and training. Nzimande has  appointed a ministerial task team to conduct a strategic review of the  NSF. The task team will, among other things, look at “the general operations of the NSF, its efficiency and relevance with regards to the national skills priorities of the country”.  The team will hand over a final report  by June. TimesLIVE
