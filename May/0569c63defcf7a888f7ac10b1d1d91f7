Government has denied allegations by the DA that  National Treasury is refusing to release funds allocated for rebuilding parts of KwaZulu-Natal  destroyed by floods last month. Spokesperson Phumla Williams said the allegations are malicious and  work is under way by  government to help communities rebuild. Williams  said government allocated relief  in a phased approach, with the first being  immediate humanitarian relief and the second phase involving reconstruction and repair. President Cyril Ramaphosa and finance minister Enoch Godongwana revealed last month that R1bn had been set aside to help rebuild homes and infrastructure destroyed by torrential rains in the province. In its media briefing earlier this week, the DA said  funds were no longer coming and  affected municipalities would have to reprioritise their budgets to rebuild. Williams, however, said a process needs to be followed before the funds can be released. “The process includes provinces and municipalities making applications for these funds to the National Disaster Management Centre and department of human settlements who,  after processing them, submit them to National Treasury. The funds are available shortly after National Treasury receives and processes an application.” She assured South Africans  no-one will be left behind in the process of rebuilding. “It has been just over a month since heavy flooding wreaked havoc across parts of KwaZulu-Natal, the Eastern Cape and North West.  In all these provinces, government and all stakeholders have been hard at work to recover from these tragic events. Government is mobilising all available resources and undertaking every effort to ensure that, as we rebuild, no-one is left behind,” said Williams.
