One person has been critically hurt in a car crash on the N2 South near the Ballito offramp in KZN. Southbound traffic is at a standstill after the crash on Wednesday afternoon. This is according to Paul Herbst of Medi Response, who said one person is in a critical condition after a truck collided with a light motor vehicle. He said it appears that the truck had rear-ended the car, critically injuring the driver. The inured will be transported to a nearby medical facility. "Traffic is severely affected. Please consider alternative routes," said Herbst. TimesLIVE
