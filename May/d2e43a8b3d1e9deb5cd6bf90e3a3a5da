Tottenham Hotspur manager Antonio Conte told Mikel Arteta to stop complaining and focus on his own team after the Arsenal boss criticised the referee following Thursday's 3-0 defeat that cut his side's advantage in the top four race to just one point. Arteta was fuming after referee Paul Tierney pointed to the spot in the 22nd minute - which Harry Kane converted - and  showed a second yellow to Rob Holding 11 minutes later for a foul on Son Heung-min. "If I say what I think I am suspended for six months," said Arteta. "I don't know how to lie so I prefer not to say what I think. It's a shame because such a beautiful game was destroyed today." Conte, whose team eased to victory on the back of a Kane double and a strike from Son, was unhappy with Arteta's assessment of the referee. "Mikel Arteta is a really good coach. He's  started to do this job and I think  I hear him complain a lot. I think  he needs to be focused more on his team and not  complain," he said. "The red card for me, it was clear. Don't forget against Liverpool I said nothing about what happened with Fabinho." The Italian hinted  it was unfair that Arsenal were able to get the original fixture rearranged on the grounds of Covid-19 even though the squad had only one positive case. "Arsenal were good to postpone a game in an incredible way with Covid-19 and they only had one player infected. I didn't forget this. If he wants to complain, we have a lot of possibilities to complain," said Conte. Fourth-placed Arsenal, who lead Spurs by a point with two games remaining, travel to Newcastle United on Monday while Conte's side host Burnley a day earlier.
