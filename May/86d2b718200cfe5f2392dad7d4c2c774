EFF leader Julius Malema does not believe the removal of the public protector on the basis that her rulings were overturned in court is rational. “You cannot fire a public protector for losing [court] cases. “To even think that we must destroy [the] public protector for a questionable character like [President] Cyril [Ramaphosa]? We can’t do that even for Nelson Mandela,” Malema said Malema addressed media on Monday and said the EFF was well on its way to 1-million members, as it now has more than 600,000 members. TimesLIVE
