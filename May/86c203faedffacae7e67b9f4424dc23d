About 9-million applications have  been received for the R350 social relief of distress (SRD) grant since the application channel opened on April 23. Speaking to TimesLIVE, SA Social Security Agency (Sassa) spokesperson Paseka Letsatsi said the agency has seen an increase in new applicants for the grant. “Most applications are from those who  previously applied for the grant. “In the last cycle, more than 15-million applications were received, of which approximately 10.6-million were approved and paid,” he said. Last month, Sassa urged applicants to reapply for the grant after it was shifted from the Disaster Management Act to the Social Assistance Act following the end of the national state of disaster. Speaking on SAfm, Letsatsi said the shift would not affect payments  for those who have already been approved. “Since the state of disaster ended, the grant  has to be included under the Social Assistance Act. Sassa cannot process applications without making sure  the law is followed. “It is  an administrative arrangement  we are confident will be resolved and not leave people behind. We don’t want people to panic,” said Letsatsi. More application portals  opened On Monday Sassa announced  the WhatsApp line is now open for R350 grant applications. “Our Whatsapp application channel for the special Covid-19 SRD grant is active,” said Sassa. The agency urged applicants who reapplied using the website srd.sassa.gov.za not to  apply again on WhatsApp. How can I apply using WhatsApp?
