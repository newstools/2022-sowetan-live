Morocco's Wydad Casablanca were held at home in the second leg of their Caf Champions League semifinal on Friday but still advanced to the final with a 4-2 aggregate triumph over Petro Atletico of Angola. Friday's 1-1 draw followed a 3-1 away win last weekend for Wydad, who will meet either Al Ahly of Egypt or Algeria's Entente Setif of Algeria in the May 30 final in Casablanca. It will be a fifth final for Wydad, who were African champions in 1992 and 2017. Petro took a surprise 21st minute lead with a long range shot from wide out on the wing by Brazilian import Gleison but seven minutes later the home teams centre back Amine Ferhane headed home an equaliser from a corner. Wydad will know the identity of their opponents on Saturday when Setif host the second leg of their semifinal against holders Al Ahly. The Cairo giants lead 4-0 from the first leg last Saturday.
