The manner in which the Free State provincial government, through the department of human settlements, handled its R1bn housing project was a “dismal failure.” The money was meant to build thousands of low cost houses. However, the houses were never built. This is contained in part 4 of the state capture inquiry report  released on Friday morning. “After the investigation and  hearing of evidence, it has become crystal clear  this project was a debacle, hence the title of this chapter, The Free State R1bn Housing Project Debacle, because of the manner in which the Free State provincial government, through its department of human settlements, handled the project. It was a dismal failure: a debacle,” reads the  report by chief justice and state capture inquiry chairperson Raymond Zondo. A total of R1.3bn was allocated for the construction of housing units to address the backlog of 200,000 houses. TimesLIVE
