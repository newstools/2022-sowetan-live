Sekhukhune United have roped experienced coach Owen Da Gama into their technical team, the DStv Premiership club has confirmed. Former Bafana Bafana assistant coach Da Gama, who was sacked by TS Galaxy early in the current season — in September last year — will hold the role of co-coach with MacDonald Makhubedu, who has been the head coach since the beginning of the season. “Da Gama has been part of SA football history for many years and also won the Telkom Knockout in 2006,” Sekhukhune chairperson Simon Malatji said. “Sekhukhune United are particularly keen to appoint SA coaches and express commitment and confidence in the talent and ability of our local coaches.” With five games for the club to play in the 2021-22 Premiership, Sekhukhune find themselves in 10th place with 30 points. They are 12 points above bottom-placed Baroka FC and 10 points above 15th-placed Swallows FC in the relegation zone. Da Gama will be expected to use his vast experience to guide the team to a more respectable position. “I have to get into the heads of the players. I have to understand where they are and what are their ambitions. Where do they want to go?” Da Gama said. “By understanding how a player thinks, then you can motivate them in a direction they want to go.” Sekhukhune, who have sunk in the league standings after bright first half of their promotion season, meet also-battling Lamontville Golden Arrows at Princess Magogo Stadium in Durban on Saturday at 3pm. Arrows, who recently sacked coach Lehlohonolo Seema after a 6-0 drubbing to league leaders Mamelodi Sundowns, are in ninth position with 31 points. The Durban club are under the leadership of caretaker coaches Vusumuzi Vilakazi and Mabhuti Khenyeza. Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
