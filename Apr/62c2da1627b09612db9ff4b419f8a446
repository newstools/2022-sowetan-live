Toyota SA on Wednesday announced  it has  suspended activities at its flood-damaged manufacturing plant in Prospecton, KwaZulu-Natal, while an assessment and clean-up operations takes place. The carmaker said  this will be extended when the production facility enters the reparation phase. Though the plant,  south of Durban, received several plumbing upgrades to mitigate water damage  after the floods of 2017, these countermeasures were  not  enough to cope with the floods after the banks of the Mlazi River broke on April 12. The damage caused to the plant has not yet been  quantified, though Toyota SA  said a more accurate forecast  on the resumption of production  would be provided once assessments  were completed. From a sales perspective, this natural disaster has  impacted on the carmaker's  ability to deliver new vehicles. Of the  water-damaged vehicles assessed, 500  have passed inspection and will be retailed. The remainder — Toyota did not confirm how many — will have to be scrapped. Leon Theron, senior vice-president of sales and marketing, said  customers whose vehicles were destroyed would be prioritised. “This will be easier to facilitate with imported CBU vehicles, as these are sourced from other plants. There is a pipeline for all imported vehicles, but we will try to increase this supply  to make up for the units lost." “Locally-produced models, such as the Hilux, are more of a challenge and we will  contact customers to inform them of the delays in production," said Theron. While no staff  died of injuries, Toyota SA  extended condolences to the families who  suffered loss  in the flooding. TimesLIVE
