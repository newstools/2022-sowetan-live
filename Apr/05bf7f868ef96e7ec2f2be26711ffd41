Stuart Baxter’s tenure with Kaizer Chiefs was expected to officially conclude on Thursday following a meeting between the coach and the club’s hierarchy. Relations between the parties sunk to a new low after last weekend’s defeat to SuperSport United, where supporters called for Baxter’s head and the coach appeared to remonstrate with the fans in turn. He went on to state in his post-match press conference that he was prepared to leave the club if fans and management so wished and, SowetanLive has been told, he will be granted his wish following conclusion of a termination agreement sometime today. Baxter had signed a two-year deal upon return to Naturena last year for a second stint, but has found it tough-going as Amakhosi battle for consistency this season. His first spell between 2012 and 2015 brought a haul of four trophies, including two league titles, but the Briton’s stubbornness is said to be one of the main reasons he’s finding it hard to get results this time. SowetanLive understands an initial meeting between club and coach took place on Wednesday where tempers flared, but no conclusion was reached on the coach’s future until reports emerged this morning that he had been sacked. The situation is now untenable and the parties will officially confirm a mutual parting of ways following a meeting, with assistant coaches Dillon Sheppard and Arthur Zwane poised to take over the reins for tomorrow’s match away to Stellenbosch. Fourth-placed Chiefs recorded 11 wins out of their 23 league games but, pointedly, bowed out at the first round of the MTN8 and Nedbank Cup under Baxter.
