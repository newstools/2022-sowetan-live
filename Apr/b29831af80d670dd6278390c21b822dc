The suspect was spotted by  police in the street and when they approached him he ran into the shop. “He was apprehended [inside the shop] by members of the  Nelson Mandela Bay district crime combating unit. “A  revolver and 10 rounds of ammunition were confiscated.” The firearm was reported stolen in the Walmer area in November 2001.
