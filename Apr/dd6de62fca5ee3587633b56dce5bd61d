A female security guard and a male colleague who allegedly handcuffed a teenager to a pole, stripped  off his clothes and lashed him with a belt over R50 will appear in court on Friday on charges of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm (GBH) and indecent assault. The 16-year-old was allegedly assaulted on Tuesday in Tigane,  in Hartbeesfontein outside Klerksdorp. “According to reports, the female suspect who is security officer  gave the boy a R50 note to buy her a cooldrink. However, the boy neither bought the drink nor gave the money back to the woman,” said North West  police spokesperson Brig Sabata Mokgwabone. “[She] allegedly looked for the boy and found him and took him to the  clinic where she is working. With assistance from her male colleague, she allegedly chained the boy to a pole with handcuffs and then undressed and assaulted him with a belt. “During the incident a video was captured with a cellphone camera and later circulated on  social media platforms.” In the video a male can be heard hurling insults at the teen and inciting the woman to beat him harder, said Mokgwabone. “The severely assaulted victim was  taken by a good Samaritan to another clinic for medical treatment as the one where the incident took place was apparently closed.” TimesLIVE
