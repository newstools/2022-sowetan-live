The water level  of the Vaal Dam  rose to 115% on Wednesday,  prompting  authorities to open  eight sluice gates. Last Wednesday, the department announced that five sluice gates were open due to the huge amount of inflows  after the recent downpours. Department of water and sanitation spokesperson Sputnik Ratau said there had been more inflows into the dam since last week. “Levels  rose as we have had more inflows.  Two days ago the dam level was at 110%. It continues to rise.” Ratau said  opening sluice gates would reduce the dam’s capacity. The warning  issued last week  for residents living downstream to remain vigilant still applies and was now more critical. He urged communities with equipment in and near the dam to remove them  to avoid damage. TimesLIVE
