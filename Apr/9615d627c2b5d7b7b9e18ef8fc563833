City Power said on Monday  if all goes according to plan, repair work at Eldorado Park substation, which was gutted by fire on Friday, will see power restored by Wednesday. Some parts of Johannesburg were left without power due to the blaze. “We remain hopeful  repairs will be done and power restored by Wednesday if all goes according to plan. We appeal for patience and co-operation from  residents while we work on  repairs. We apologise for the inconvenience this is causing to the livelihoods, businesses and  lives of  residents,” said City Power spokesperson Isaac Mangena. SowetanLIVE's sister publication TimesLIVE reported on Friday that Johannesburg Water  confirmed  power outages due to the fire had  affected its infrastructure and could lead to water outages. Mangena said the fire damaged one transformer. A second one  was affected by the heat and will be tested. The control room was also damaged. “We are worried about the increase in vandalism and theft of  infrastructure in and around Eldorado Park while we are busy with  repairs at the substation. We appeal to residents to be vigilant and report any suspicious movement around  electricity infrastructure,” he said. He said work had progressed well  despite threatening rainfall. TimesLIVE
