Stage 2 load-shedding will be implemented from 5pm on Tuesday, says Eskom. The enforced  outages are expected to end at 5am on Wednesday. Monday’s overnight load-shedding was suspended at 5am today, but Eskom said it continues to experience a shortage of generation capacity. “This constrained supply situation will persist throughout the week, with the possibility  more load-shedding  will be implemented should  generation capacity deteriorate further,” the utility cautioned. Unit 5 at Medupi power station returned to service during the night, but three generating units at the Camden Power Station tripped, contributing to the  shortage of capacity. Eskom said its teams are working  to return as many of these units to service as soon as possible. “We  have 4,804MW on planned maintenance while another 14,449MW of capacity is unavailable due to unplanned breakdowns. “We are managing the emergency generation reserves to limit the stage of load-shedding. The overnight load-shedding will be used to replenish  dam levels at the pump storage power stations in preparation for the remainder of the week.” TimesLIVE .
