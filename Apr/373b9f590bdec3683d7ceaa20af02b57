When Meli Sokela recounts the story of the day his home was destroyed by flooding, the pain is visible in his eyes. He recalls a loud noise like thunder before the wall of his home collapsed. “I hear a noise like a thunderstorm, thereafter I hear the sound of the walls falling on to me and my child. After that, I tried to call my neighbours to  help me. They  tried to help me for  two hours.  I survived but unfortunately my child did not,” he told Reuters. Sokela is one of hundreds of people to have lost loved ones. Officials have placed the death toll at 306. Another Durban resident, Jomba Phiri, spoke about his brush with death.  He was trapped in a mudslide along with this son. TimesLIVE
