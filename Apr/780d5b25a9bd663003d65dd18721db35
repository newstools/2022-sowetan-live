Burials in Durban cemeteries resumed on Friday after widespread flooding in the city. eThekwini municipal  spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela confirmed  the public could make bookings  to lay their loved ones to rest. “Burial bookings are  open, except for eTafuleni where conditions are not yet conducive for burials,” he said. Mayisela said  people should first visit the relevant cemetery office to ascertain the availability of burial space. Due to flooding, the city was unable to accept requests for burials until the situation improved. “This was due to ground being saturated after heavy rains. We monitored the situation at all our grave sites to ensure  we are able to conduct burials. Since Tuesday, our councillors and officials are working closely with families of the deceased to ensure  burial assistance is provided,” said Mayisela. TimesLIVE
