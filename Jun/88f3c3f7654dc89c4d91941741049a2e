The SA Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) will visit  Qhumanco village in Cofimvaba  after reports of  tensions between South Africans  and foreigners  in the area. The SAHRC  said it had noted reports of violence resulting in multiple deaths in the area. Reports  had also alluded to allegations of xenophobia which had emanated from criminal conduct and  distrust between members of the community. “The commission’s Eastern Cape provincial office will  visit the area tomorrow,  June 21,  to assess the concerns of the  community and engage relevant stakeholders on the ground. “The SAHRC  calls on the SA Police Service to provide the necessary resources to investigate the reported deaths, elements of criminality, as well as quelling concerns of retaliatory xenophobic attacks.” It also called on officials, traditional leaders and the community of Qhumanco to remain law abiding and to resolve issues in a manner  acceptable in a democracy.
