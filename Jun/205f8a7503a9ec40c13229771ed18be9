Two members of a Limpopo church drowned in a baptism ritual at Masetheko Dam. The drownings come a week after a Limpopo pastor, Titus Mosima, and one of his congregants, Noko Suzen-Chaba, drowned during a baptism in the Mogol River in Lephalale. The latest drowning occurred on Sunday. Limpopo police spokesperson Lt-Col Mamphaswa Seabi said a pastor was conducting a baptism ritual at Masetheko Dam when four people, who were to be baptised, fell into the water. “One of the people managed to swim and get out. A woman was rescued. The remaining two men drowned. “The bodies were retrieved by police search and rescue divers.” Seabi said the drowning victims had been identified as 21-year-old Elvis Ramakgaphola and 29-year-old Michael Rampa. Police provincial commissioner Lt-Gen Thembi Hadebe cautioned people to be careful around dams and rivers. Two cases of inquests have been opened and police investigations are continuing. TimesLIVE
