KwaZulu-Natal social development MEC Nonhlanhla Khoza has called on parents to stand by their children, a move she hopes  will change their lives and ensure  they don’t fall prey to social ills. Khoza was speaking on Tuesday during a youth socio-empowerment  programme in uMthalume, south of Durban. She believes   strong support from parents and communities at large can ensure youth  achieve  in the corporate world. “The youth are facing significant challenges which often lead to failure to fulfil their dreams. We believe  every person can grow and thrive when getting support from those who are closest to their lives,” she said. The area  was thrust into the spotlight when  five women were murdered by a suspected serial killer in August 2020. This also prompted the MEC to respond to a call made by local youth for the department to create skills which would cushion them from being lured into criminality. About 35 youths who recently graduated from the youth development academies received a boost when the MEC, in partnership with the  National Youth Development Agency, provided them with start-up kits relevant to their skills of choice. The initiative is sponsored by the department and uMzumbe municipality. “We ensure every child who comes into our academies leaves with a qualification and a driver’s licence. We have also provided them with start-up kits which would enable them to set up their own business,” she said. Khoza remained confident  all the beneficiaries would be able to start thriving businesses. “We want to see young people leading successful businesses and being self-sustainable.” TimesLIVE
