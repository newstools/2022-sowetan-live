A KwaZulu-Natal pupil who was suspended from school over her traditional attire, but was later allowed to return after the education department intervened,  has ended her life. On Tuesday the provincial education department said  it was saddened by the news of the death of the 15-year-old pupil from Nombika High in the iLembe district. The pupil was reportedly suspended over traditional attire she had to wear because of her ancestral calling. “The deceased was recently in the news because of the problem she had with the school regarding her traditional rituals. “The department intervened  and she was back at the school, being taught like all others.” According to the department, the pupil wrote all her June examinations. “The department has not established  what led to  her  taking the  decision to end her own life. The iLembe district director has sent a team to her family to establish the circumstances around her untimely death,” it said. TimesLIVE
