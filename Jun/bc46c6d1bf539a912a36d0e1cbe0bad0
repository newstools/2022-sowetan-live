The ANC regional chair in eThekwini, Zandile Gumede, and her  co-accused are set to appear in the Durban high court on Monday. The former mayor and her 17 co-accused are facing a barrage of corruption and fraud charges in the R320m Durban Solid Waste case. According to the office of the chief justice, Monday marks the pre-trial  proceedings, as part of preparations for the trial set down from July 18 to August 31. A large media contingent  gathered outside the court in anticipation of Gumede's arrival. However, none of Gumede's supporters were  in sight. This is a developing story. TimesLIVE
