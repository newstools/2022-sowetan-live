For more than  80 years, Mzansi’s most loved cooking companion, Koo, has been the epicentre of many family moments, celebrations and memories created through our mutual fondness for food. Beyond introducing a plethora of innovations to elevate our meals — including the newly launched Koo Pilchards — the heritage brand has done immense work in inspiring and empowering the communities it serves. For instance, four young aspiring chefs were recently awarded the opportunity to jump-start their careers courtesy of the Koo Culinary Bursary. Lungelo Mbele from Durban, Kamohelo Mokhele from Bloemfontein, Kgothatso  Mathibe from Pretoria and Lihle Mahambehlala from Johannesburg — see one of her tasty recipes below — will get to sharpen their culinary skills at the prestigious Jackie Cameron School of Food & Wine for one year. They'll also be mentored by celebrity chef and Colour Your Plate with Koo judge, Reuben Riffle. Koo is not only determined to help SA's next generation of superstar chefs realise their dreams, but also to nurture the passions of the “culture benders” of tomorrow. That's why it has also teamed up with popular youth street wear label, Thesis Lifestyle, to create a cool collection of merchandise for fans of the Koo brand that includes T-shirts, bucket hats and hoodies. From food to fashion, these exciting collaborations speak to Koo's ongoing commitment to empower SA's youth and foster economic change.
