Gauteng residents have been warned to brace themselves for more cold weather  until Wednesday next week. The regional weather forecaster announced on Thursday that temperatures will dip with a strong possibility of storms. In parts of Gauteng, temperatures reached  lows of 0, -1ºC and -2ºC, according to a report issued by the SA Weather Service. The announcement comes after Gautengers emerged from the coldest night of 2022 on Wednesday, with temperatures reaching a low of -3°C in Vereeniging and -1 °C in Johannesburg. Pretoria reached a low of 1°C. City of Johannesburg Emergency Management Services (EMS) said it is on high alert and  urged residents to take care with heating devices that may be hazardous. “Exercise caution with  heating devices in this chilly weather affecting  Johannesburg. Do not leave heating appliances or fires unattended. Tragedy happens in a matter of seconds,” it said. EMS spokesperson Robert Mulaudzi told Newzroom Afrika emergency services are monitoring informal settlements. “We are monitoring vulnerable communities, which are our informal settlements. The issue of illegal power connections is becoming a problem and we  urge  residents to report these situations because they are not only dangerous to themselves, but to the residents around them and they cause devastating fire incidents.” Mulaudzi said emergency services are raising safety awareness in communities.
